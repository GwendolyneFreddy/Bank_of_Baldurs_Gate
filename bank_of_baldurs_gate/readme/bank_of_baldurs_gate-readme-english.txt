BANK OF BALDURS GATE for EET v. 0.2
by Lassal
 
The main idea of this mod is a throught, that often player is left without money.
And it's stoopid that in big city of Baldurs Gate there is not a single bank.
So I made this mod.
 
Near Iron Throne building there is a locked dwelling with ogre magi inside.
This is a Bank of Baldurs Gate, that was blocked due to robbing by ogres.
After you kill ogre magi, you may return after one day passed and find, that bank returned to work.
Go to second floor and open a deposit in talk with director Billboo:-)
You can leave him your money or take from him any time.
 
Director will be waiting for you near bank after initial happenings of Siege of Dragonspear, so you can take your money from deposit if needed.
 
PS You need separate mod, that enables visiting Baldurs Gate city after BG2 part started, to get to bank and retrieve your money in BG2 part of events.
PPS All avatars for bank's personnel are available under Creative Commons C0 license and were acquired from pixabay.com site. These avatars don't require mentioning authors and can be used in commercial means (this mod is not commercial, of cause).
PPPS Don't know how to rename location name or place location on area map yet.
